# PASTIS

## PASTIS

PASTIS stands for (P)rocessing (AS)sessment (T)echnique for (I)mproved (S)pectroscopy ;)

PASTIS can be used to process and quantify single-voxel Magnetic Resonance SPectroscopy (MRS) data. It can also simulate MRS data using various MRS sequences for different B0 fields.

PASTIS relies a lot on the suspect package. More info here: https://github.com/openmrslab/suspect

## Credits

PASTIS was originally written by Tangi Roussel. If you are using PASTIS or part of it in your work, please cite the original paper:

## Installation

### Python package

PASTIS was developped on Python 3.7 and can be installed with *pip* using this command line:

```
pip install -e path/to/the/folder/pastis
```

### GAMMA

GAMMA is a system package used for NMR simulations. It can be installed on Debian-based system using this command-line:

```
apt-get install gamma
```

More info about GAMMA on https://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/

### GAMMA alternative



## Usage
