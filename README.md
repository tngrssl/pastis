# PASTIS

## PASTIS

PASTIS stands for (P)rocessing (AS)sessment (T)echnique for (I)mproved (S)pectroscopy ;)

PASTIS can be used to process and quantify single-voxel Magnetic Resonance SPectroscopy (MRS) data. It can also simulate MRS data using various MRS sequences for different B0 fields.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.7
* Python packages:
    * pyGAMMA (https://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/wiki/PyGamma)
    * numpy suspect pandas pymapvbvd xlrd termcolor

* GAMMA library installed on system (https://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/)
