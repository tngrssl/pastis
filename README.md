# PASTIS

## PASTIS

PASTIS stands for (P)rocessing (AS)sessment (T)echnique for (I)mproved (S)pectroscopy ;)

PASTIS can be used to process and quantify single-voxel Magnetic Resonance SPectroscopy (MRS) data. It can also simulate MRS data using various MRS sequences for different B0 fields.

PASTIS relies a lot on the suspect package. More info here: https://github.com/openmrslab/suspect

## Requirements (see requirements.txt)

* Python 3.7
* Python packages:
    * pygamma numpy suspect pandas pymapvbvd xlrd termcolor

* GAMMA library installed on system (https://scion.duhs.duke.edu/vespa/gamma/)
    * apt-get install gamma (Debian/Ubuntu)

## Features

* Read raw data from Siemens (TWIX MR Syngo VB17)
* Read raw data from Bruker (fid files)
* Read dicom data (standard dicom, Siemens MR Syngo VB17, Siemens MR Syngo XA20)
