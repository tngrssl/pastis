## TODO

* extract VOI orientation from dcm/twix files and improve voxel_size, CSDE and VOI anatomy methods

* Parallelize stuff: data rejecting approaches

* Find a gitable non-binary format to store the metabolite db and basis sets (I was thinking of FODS but it is not really implemented in conda...)

* HDF5/ISMRMD format save/load: for now, only save the MRS signal with a few attributes. If needed, will complete implementation

* Implement partial volume stuff for absolute quantification
